            <h2>My Kode<span>Go Journey</span></h2>
            <p>
                I was a chat support representative, a freelancer and a full-time dad before joining KodeGo bootcamp. I discovered the bootcamp through YouTube ads and saw it as a chance for a new career. Despite having no prior coding knowledge, I eagerly learned from our teacher and engaged in self-study. My motivation was to provide a better future for my family, especially my children. I acknowledged the seriousness of coding and appreciated the opportunities and learnings provided by KodeGo. I am approaching the end of the program with confidence in my ability to achieve my dream career, thanks to KodeGo's support in connecting them with potential employers. I consider my journey with KodeGo a significant milestone in my life.</p>

            <h3>My Hob<span>bies</span></h3>
            <p>
                I like to play basketball sometimes. I love playing the guitar and writing songs. I am also a singer in
                videoke especially when there is an occasion or event. Sometimes I was even hired to sing at a weddings and
                debuts. Editing images and videos is also my hobby. Above all I am an online PC gamer and now I am
                obsessed with coding in html so I am now studying at KodeGo to become a Professional Web Developer.
