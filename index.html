	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Hi! I am Mark Joseph Dizon Mateo and you can call me Macoy. I am an entry</p>
	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;">level front-end web developer. I can show some of my projects from my graduate
		school and I can assure you that</p>
	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;">I can give you the best and attractive web design you'll ever wish. My last
		job before going to school is</p>
	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;">working at a BPO company as a Chat Support Representative. After that I did
		freelancing then I decided to join a</p>
	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;">bootcamp at KodeGo to learn how to code and to develope and design a perfect
		website or webpage for you.</p>
