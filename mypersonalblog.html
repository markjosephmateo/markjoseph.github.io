            <h2>My Kode<span>Go Journey</span></h2>
            <p>
                Before I went to KodeGo's bootcamp, I was a chat support representative in a BPO company SYKES ASIA
                INC. After that I
                resigned because the work was on site and it was not possible because I was away from the office
                and I was also a full time dad. I was working as a freelancer and then I saw KodeGo bootcamp on
                youtube ads and I tried because I
                saw my possible new career here that I still have a chance. Since day 1 of KodeGo, I didn't
                really know much as in 0 (zero)
                knowledge, but when our teacher discussed, I gradually absorbed everything he taught along with
                my self learning on
                YouTube even outside of class time. I'm really eager to learn this for the future of my family,
                especially my children. I learned coding and different types of coding here. Joining this boot
                camp is not a joke or a game. You need to be serious especially in coding because if this is
                the career you really want to enter. I learned a lot here at KodeGo's bootcamp and I was not
                wrong in my decision to enter here. Now that our class is about to end and I will soon reach my
                dream career with the help of
                KodeGo because KodeGo will also help me find potential employers. Thank you very much for the
                opportunity given by KodeGo to become a Professional and successful in life. My Journey with
                KodeGo is a history of mine.</p>

            <h3>My Hob<span>bies</span></h3>
            <p>
                I like to play basketball sometimes. I love playing the guitar and writing songs. I am also a singer in
                videoke especially when there is an occasion or event. Sometimes I was even hired to sing at a weddings and
                debuts. Editing images and videos is also my hobby. Above all I am an online PC gamer and now I am
                obsessed with coding in html so I am now studying at KodeGo to become a Professional Web Developer.
